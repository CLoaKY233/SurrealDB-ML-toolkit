# SurrealDB and PyTorch Integration for Linear Regression

## Overview

This code demonstrates the integration of SurrealDB with PyTorch for a linear regression task. It covers data storage, retrieval, preprocessing, model training, and prediction.

### What the Code Does

1. Connects to SurrealDB and inserts sample data
2. Retrieves data and prepares it for machine learning
3. Builds a PyTorch linear regression model
4. Trains the model on the data
5. Evaluates the model and makes predictions

### SurrealDB Interaction

The code interacts with SurrealDB for data storage and retrieval:

```python
async with Surreal("ws://localhost:8000/rpc") as db:
    await db.signin({"user": "root", "pass": "root"})
    await db.use("test", "test")

    # Insert data
    for house in houses:
        await db.create("house", house)

    # Retrieve data
    result = await db.select("house")
```

### PyTorch Model

A simple linear regression model is defined using PyTorch:

```python
class LinearRegression(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim):
        super(LinearRegression, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(input_dim, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)
```

## Learning Prompts

To better understand and recreate this code, consider the following questions:

1. How would you establish a connection to SurrealDB using Python?

2. What are the basic CRUD operations in SurrealDB, and how can you implement them?

3. How can you convert data from SurrealDB into a format suitable for machine learning?

4. What is the purpose of `StandardScaler` in preprocessing, and how do you use it?

5. How do you define a simple linear regression model using PyTorch's `nn.Module`?

6. Explain the purpose of the `forward` method in PyTorch models.

7. How do you split data into training and testing sets, and why is this important?

8. What are loss functions and optimizers in PyTorch, and how do you choose appropriate ones for linear regression?

9. Write a basic training loop for a PyTorch model. What elements should it include?

10. How would you use a trained PyTorch model to make predictions on new data?
