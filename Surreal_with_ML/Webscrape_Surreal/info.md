# Amazon Product Scraper with SurrealDB Integration

## Overview

This Python script scrapes product data from Amazon based on a user-specified search term and number of pages. It then stores the collected data in a SurrealDB database.

## Key Components

### Web Scraping
```python
def scrape_amazon(search_term, num_pages=1):
    # ... (scraping logic)
    return all_products
```
This function uses `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` to scrape product information from Amazon.

### Database Integration
```python
async with Surreal("ws://localhost:8000/rpc") as db:
    await db.signin({"user": "root", "pass": "root"})
    await db.use("test", "test")
    # ... (database operations)
```
The script connects to SurrealDB asynchronously and inserts the scraped data.

### Main Execution
```python
async def main():
    # ... (user input and scraping)
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        product_data = {
            "title": row["Title"],
            "price": row["Price"],
            "rating": row["Rating"],
            "review_count": row["Reviews"]
        }
        await db.create("amazon_products", product_data)
```
The main function orchestrates the scraping process and database insertion.

## Learning Prompts

1. How would you modify the scraping function to handle different product categories on Amazon?

2. What are the potential legal and ethical considerations when web scraping? How can you ensure compliance?

3. How would you implement error handling and retries in the scraping process?

4. Can you explain the purpose of the headers in the HTTP request? How do they affect the scraping process?

5. How would you modify the code to scrape additional product details like product description or seller information?

6. What are the advantages of using an asynchronous database connection with SurrealDB?

7. How would you implement data validation before inserting into SurrealDB?

8. Can you explain how to modify the SurrealDB schema to optimize queries for the scraped data?

9. How would you implement a feature to update existing products in the database instead of creating duplicates?

10. What strategies could you employ to make the scraping process more efficient and faster?
